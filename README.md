# Javascript Experiments Puzzles and Bonfires
Different experiments and exercises I've been doing with Javascript, some are from bonfires in Free Code Camp, some are from tutorials I'm reading and some are just my own thing that I thought up.

Object-prototyping/toys - playing with the Javascript object prototyping system

bind-call-apply - testing these three functions and how they work.

functional programming - dipping my toes into functional programming for the first time

javascript closures test - This one was frustrating to implement at first, playing with Javascript closures

javascript fibinocci - a script that shows an array of Fibinocci numbers

Javascript Roman test - a small script that converts numbers that go up to 38 into Roman numerals, any higher number requires you to add more Roman numeral strings into the Roman array and it's modern numbers counterpart. This is a simplified script of something I've found on another website, don't remember the address.
